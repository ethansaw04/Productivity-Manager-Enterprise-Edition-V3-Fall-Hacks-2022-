**Introduction:**

1.  Our Productivity app allows the user to test mental and neural pathways and build them throughout simple yet complex tasks all in a time frame. Our tasks range from identifying keys words to figuring out math problems. Using a timer throughout the program, it applies pressure to the user to finish and to think through the problems quckly. However, if the user cannot finish these tasks at a certain time frame, our **motivators** will influence the user to do better, before time runs out.... (Feel free for the timer to keep going during the second set of tasks) **Epilepsy Warning!!**

(Feel free for the timer to keep going during the second set of tasks) Walkthrough We can offer a demo Once you get started, the program will automatically cater a set of problems to you using our machine learning algorithms created through datasets of your browsing history. This is our menu page which displays our logo and the start button Once this is pressed, we have different tasks for the user to complete Starting with the first few tasks, it gives beginner questions just to figure out the program and start off slow. As you can see here, it starts off with selecting a
